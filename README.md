# AirVnP

AirVnP is a web app designed to help users find the greatest venues in London for hire. Be it a conference, wedding, or company-wide party, discover exactly what you need on AirVnP.

AirVnP was built as part of our first project during Le Wagon's 10 week Web Development bootcamp. The venues were generated using fake addresses to demonstrate the idea. Unfortunately it can not be accessed in production due to Heroku's new pricing updates. You may find screenshots of the web app <a href="https://troopl.com/malik/airvnp">here</a>.
